Logic:
	effective dates:
		the date the product you purchase starts to cover you
		The date you buy(successful submit to siebel/paying)
		AEP -> Annual enrollment Period (u65 -> mean the same thing)
		Interchangeable  different thing for U65 && O65
		SEP - Special Enrollment Period ( All year long ) -> anytime you want to buy you need a reason to change (QLE) Qualifying|Qualified life event -> impact on effective date

Reason for enrollment -> enrollment
Products -> medicare/ non medicare /
Generic Rule -> 60/70% of case fall in this rule ***u65 medical, dental, vision***
	if <date> before 16th, effective date <= 1st of next month
		if <date>  on or after 16, effective date <= 1st of month after next month

		u65 is only 1st (meaning no start on the 15th
		ex:    date  | eff date
		<16   1/12/19| 2/1/2019
		=16   3/16/19| 5/1/2019
		>16   4/20/19| 6/1/2019
String marketSegment,
                                   String situation,
                                   LocalDate eventDate,
                                   LocalDate referenceDate,
                                   List<LocalDate> listOfEffectiveDates,
                                   HashMap<String, LocalDate> expirationDates

60 day window on if you can use your QLE window -> if over 65 QLE is no longer valid
***QLEs***
QLE categories:
LOSS of coverage Rule:
Breaks the rule (lose job/ lose health insurance unrealated to the job)
if event-date is on or before submit to siebel date, then <date> is submit to siebel date
else <date> is event date
(if event date is in the future date then use future if past then use siebel submit date)
If <date> before end of month => effective date is 1st of next month

ex:
     event Dt| submit Dt | eff Dt
    1/1/2019 |< 2/1/2019 |3/1/2019
    2/1/2019 |= 2/1/2019 |3/1/2019
    3/1/2019 |> 2/1/2019 |4/1/2019
ex:

Birth/Adoption rule:
Given <date>,
=> effective date choices are:
	<date> 1st of month following <date>,
	generic rule date
ex
	currentdate	date      eff date
	0	03/13/2018| 03/13/2018,04/01/2018
		03/19/2018| 03/19/2018, 04/01/2018, 05/01/2018

ATM no Generic Rule for o65****

***for change you need QLE for dental and vision***
O65 	 ( We don't determine the effective dates for medicare advantage/PDP **MAYBE** **MAYBE DETERMINED IN AMATHYST)
	Medicare Supplement
	Given <date> is before 15th, then effective dates are: 14th of current month, 1st of next month, 1st (current month + 6) % 12
Ex
	date  |  eff date
  1/1-1/14	1/15, 2/1,2/15, 3/1, 3/15, 4/1, 4/15, 5/1, 5/15, 6/1, 6/15, 7/1
  1/15-1/31   | 2/1, 2/15
Cut off date -> as in we no longer offer this product
example
	cut off date: 5/1
	1/15, 2/1,2/15, 3/1, 3/15, 4/1, **4/15** this would be the 'last date we offer this product'
